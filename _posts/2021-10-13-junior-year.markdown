I'm glad you have decided to join me on this journey! 

My name is Jacob, an electrical engineer who happens to enjoy writing code. Strange as it may seem, I spent the majority of my four years in college working as a programmer on a number of embedded systems projects -- so C and C++ are some of the languages that I am most familiar with (and, frankly, I love them). 

As we enter the third year of SARS-CoV-2 Electric Boogaloo, I find myself yearning to learn something new. I am always learning, and have many interests, but my recent desire is to expand my programming horizons. I suspect that, since you're here, that you have some interest in similar things.

I am going to be learning Rust, and logging my journey towards mastery here. Where it is illustrative, I will be comparing C/C++ syntax/features/etc. to Rust. As yet, I am no expert in Rust -- hardly a novice at this point -- though I do know C/C++ pretty well. 

Something (likely a major search engine) brought you here, and I suspect that it was interest in Rust. That being the case, pack a snack, grab a drink, and let's get this journey underway!

{% highlight c++ linenos %}
#include <iostream>

int main (int argc, char** argv)
{
  return 0;
}
{% endhighlight %}
